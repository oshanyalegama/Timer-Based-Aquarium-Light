## Key Features
- **Programmable Timers**: Choose between three preset durations (8, 10, or 12 hours), ideal for different aquatic species and environmental needs.
- **Easy Reset**: A long-press reset button simplifies reconfiguration.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Visual indicators (LEDs) display the active timer setting, making it intuitive to use.
- **Compact and Lightweight**: Enclosure dimensions: 12cm x 7cm x 50cm, weighing less than 100g.
- **Universal Compatibility**: Designed for aquarium lights operating at 12V DC.

## Implementation
The system comprises:
1. **Power Supply Unit**: Converts 240V AC to 12V DC for operation.
2. **Control Unit**: Processes user inputs and manages timer functions using the ATmega328P microcontroller.
3. **Relay Module**: Controls power delivery to the aquarium light.
4. **Indicator LEDs**: Display the selected timer option.
5. **Enclosure**: A robust, 3D-printed housing protects components while ensuring aesthetic appeal.

## Tests and Validation
- Verified power delivery and relay functionality.
- Buttons tested for reliable activation of timer settings.

## Technologies Used
- **ATmega328P Microcontroller**: Core logic unit.
- **Arduino IDE**: Used for programming and debugging.
